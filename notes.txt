#Mitchelle Rasquinha Notes for Perf cluster validation package
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Notes are based on the tools in https://github.com/MapRPS/cluster-validation project. Professional services use this tool for verifying customer installations before and after product installation.

- Need a pre-requisite check for tools that the package depends on.
(clush, password less ssh )
- Write all scripts as smaller utilities that can be used independently when needed
